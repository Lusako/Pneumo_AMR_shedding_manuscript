**Running title**: People living with HIV on suppressive antiretroviral therapy shed multi-drug resistant pneumococci.

**Background**: People living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are reported to have over two-fold higher _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (_S. pneumoniae_) carriage prevalence than their HIV-uninfected counterparts. Pneumococcal carriage is an important risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), antimicrobial resistance (AMR) emergence, and transmission. We therefore aimed to assess pneumococcal carriage density, shedding and AMR profiles in PLHIV on ART for more than 1 year (PLHIV>1y) compared to HIV-uninfected participants.

**Methods**: Asymptomatic PLHIV>1y and HIV-uninfected participants were recruited from ART and HIV Testing clinics in Blantyre, Malawi. For the first month, participants were followed up on days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 for , and then monthly for 12 months. Pneumococcal carriage and shedding were measured using standard bacterial culture, while AMR profiling was done using disk diffusion and E-test. We futher assessed multiple carriage using whole plate sweep sequencing.

**Findings**: Pneumococcal carriage density was four times higher among PLHIV>1y compared to HIV-uninfected participants (4.1x103 vs. 1x103 CFU/ml; p<0.001). Moreover, PLHIV>1y were more likely to shed pneumococci than HIV-uninfected participants (47% 79/168 [95% CI 39.3-54.9] vs. 27.2% 18/66 [95% CI 17-39.6], p = 0.09). In PLHIV>1y, aerosol shed pneumococci were more often multi-drug resistant (MDR) than nasopharyngeal-carried pneumococci recovered from the same individual (62% 18/29 [95% CI 48%-77%] vs. 31% 9/29 [95% CI 17%-45%], p=0.018).

**Interpretation**: PLHIV on suppressive ART remain at risk of IPD but could also be an important reservoir for MDR _S. pneumoniae_ transmission. Therefore, considerations should be given to re-evaluating the provision of pneumococcal vaccination to this vulnerable adult population.
